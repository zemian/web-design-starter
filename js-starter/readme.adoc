JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language
with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language
for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic
language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative
(e.g. functional programming) styles.
