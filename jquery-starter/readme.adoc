jQuery is a JavaScript library that helps you manipulate DOM API, add animation to your HTML page,
dynamically styling and many more.

Getting started with jQuery can be easy or challenging, depending on your experience with
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and programming concepts in general.

One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery is accessed via
JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your
code. While working with jQuery regularly can, over time, improve your proficiency with JavaScript, it can be hard to
get started writing jQuery without a working knowledge of JavaScript's built-in constructs and syntax. Therefore, if
you're new to JavaScript, we recommend checking out the
