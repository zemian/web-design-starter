HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language
used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated
or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements,
which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it
appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a
hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.

At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to
pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a
bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections
(Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content
such as images and videos into a page.
