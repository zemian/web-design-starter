/*
 Starting with ECMAScript2015, JavaScript gains support for Promise objects allowing you to control the flow of
 deferred and asynchronous operations.

 A Promise is in one of these states:

 pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
 fulfilled: successful operation
 rejected: failed operation.
 settled: the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.
